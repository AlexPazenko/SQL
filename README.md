# SQL

I need to create a database with the following tables:
- Users
- Products
- OrderItems
- Orders
- Customers.

Implement a one-to-many relationship for the Products table with the Users table.
Implement a one-to-many relationship for the OrderItems table with the Orders table 
and many-to-one with the Products table.
Implement a many-to-many relationship for the Customers table with the Order table.

I need to write queries and save them in a separate file.


The database dump and sql queries file will be in the sql-lesson branch.
